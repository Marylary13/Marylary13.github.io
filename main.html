        <h3 class="colour">Highschool</h3>
        <p>
            My academic journey took a significant turn when I joined Bryanston High School in grade 10. 
            I decided to select pure maths, biology, physics, and history for my high school subjects. 
            Prior to this, I had attended a small school with limited access to computers, and I was unaware of the existence of 
            subjects like IT and CAT. Despite my passion for gaming and technology from a young age, I never considered a 
            career in software development.

    <div class="matric" id="matric">
        <h3 class="colour">Matric</h3>
        <p>
            My matric year was a challenging time, both academically and personally. Despite my hard work, 
            I faced unexpected setbacks that left me feeling defeated. I did manage to pass all my subjects, 
            although I didn't achieve the marks I needed to get into my desired course. Feeling lost and uncertain, I stumbled upon 
            Belgium Campus ITversity and attended their open day. I was impressed by their Bachelor of Computing course and 
            decided to take a chance and apply. This marked the beginning of my journey into the world of programming, and I was 
            eager to learn and explore the opportunities that lay ahead.

    <div class="uni" id="uni" >
        <h3 class="colour">Freshman in University</h3>
        <p>In my first year of university, I encountered a lot of challenges and often questioned my ability to make it in the field of programming. Despite this, I stayed positive and put a lot of work into my studies. My hard work paid off, as I managed to achieved seven distinctions that year.</p>

    <div class="present" id="present">
        <h3 class="colour">The Present</h3>
        <p>Its been a long and hard journey. Every year got more and more difficult but in the end I managed to get where I wanted to be and found my passions. Third year has been quite the challenge, and yet I'm still standing STRONG. I hope to advance further in my career and studues, I feel like you're never too old to learn and I want to continue gaining knowledge as well as experience.</p>
